Choices Packager

Purpose

Modifying vendor-supplied Apple Installer packages (.pkg files) is bad practice. Apple's supported method for choosing which options to want to install or not install is to call a choices XML file when deploying the package via command line.

Choices Packager makes it easy for an administrator to read an Apple Installer package, such as Office 2016 for Mac, and choose which optional items to install and/or not install. It then wraps the original installer and a choices XML file in a new package that's ready for deployment.


Support

This script is works for the most part. Occasionally, it may herp derp. It needs tweaking, cleaning and documenting. To use it open the .scpt file using Script Editor and click the Run button. Follow the prompts.

If you find this script useful or have ideas for improving it, please let me know. I conceived this for use with Office 2016 for Mac but it should work with any Apple Installer package that offers choices. If you find bugs or would like suggestions for improvement, please open an issue within this project.
